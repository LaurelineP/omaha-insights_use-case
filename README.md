# Omaha Dashboard Challenge - Ziggy Asset Management

## Project Overview

**Ziggy Asset Management** manages a portfolio of twenty major companies (including Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft). The objective of this project is to build a **client-facing dashboard** that provides investors with a clear and insightful view of their portfolio through data visualization.

The final submission must be **production-ready**.

## Requirements

### 1. Functionality

- Users must be able to **select exactly 3 graphs** to be displayed on the dashboard.
- Selection is made from a total list of **6 available graphs**.

### 2. Graph Types

The six available graphs are divided into two distinct categories:

- **Spot Metrics (3 graphs):** Must be rendered as **horizontal bar charts**.
- **Historical Metrics (3 graphs):** Must be rendered as **line charts**.

### 3. Data & Tech Stack

- **Data Source:** All data is located in the `data.json` file.
- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (utilizing its full range of features).
- **Libraries:** You are free to use any UI or charting library of your choice (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Lucide, Recharts, Chart.js, Tremor).

### 4. Layout

You have complete creative freedom regarding the UI/UX. A suggested layout is a side panel for selection and a main grid for the graphs, but this is not a strict requirement.

## Test Information
